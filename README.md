#  Health & Lifestyle Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling health and lifestyle survey data to predict the presence of chronic disease based on various behavioral, demographic, and lifestyle features. The goal is to develop and evaluate classification models that can assist in early risk identification and promote preventative healthcare strategies.

## Objective
To build and evaluate multiple classification models that predict whether an individual is likely to have a chronic disease based on their health and lifestyle attributes.


##  Key Steps Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized distributions, relationships, and class imbalance
   - Created count plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables

3. **Modeling**  
   - Built Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifiers
   - Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

4. **Handling Class Imbalance**  
   - Applied class weighting to improve minority class detection


## Results Summary
- Initial models showed high accuracy but poor recall for the minority class.
- After rebalancing, recall improved significantly at the cost of accuracy.



## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling & Evaluation)
